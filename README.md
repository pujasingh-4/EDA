# wine-Quality-Prediction using matchine learning
## Problem Statment

i got this project during my internship in Oasis infobyte. I have to download the dataset from kaggle WineQT to built variouse classification model to predict wheather the quality of wine is good or bad.
Each wine Quality is scored between 3 to 8.The quality of wine is determined by 11 input variable.

## Objectives
Do experiment with different classification methods to predict the good_quality wine.

## Steps taken in this project
imported nessasary libraries
Loading Data
Cleaning data
Understanding data
Checking for null values
Exporting Variables
proportion of good and bad wines
Applying differnt methods like-
1.Logical Regression
2. Random Forest 
3.Kneighbore classifier
